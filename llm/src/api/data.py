Introduction
Lord Rama is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism and is considered the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu. He is the central figure of the ancient Indian epic Ramayana, composed by Maharishi Valmiki. Rama is worshiped as the epitome of righteousness (dharma), virtue, and ideal kingship. His story, which revolves around his exile, the abduction of his wife Sita by the demon king Ravana, and his eventual triumph, serves as a moral guide for millions.

Birth and Lineage
Lord Rama was born in the illustrious Ikshvaku dynasty, which traces its origins to the Sun God (Surya), making him a Suryavanshi (Solar Dynasty) prince. He was the eldest son of King Dasharatha, the ruler of Ayodhya, and Queen Kaushalya. His birth is celebrated as Rama Navami, one of the most important Hindu festivals.

Brothers of Lord Rama
Lord Rama had three brothers, all born to different queens of King Dasharatha:

Bharata – Son of Queen Kaikeyi
Lakshmana – Son of Queen Sumitra
Shatrughna – Son of Queen Sumitra
Among them, Lakshmana was deeply devoted to Rama and accompanied him throughout his exile.
